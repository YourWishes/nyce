# Nyce
Nyce is a browser-based stream graphics framework primarily built for use with the Open Broadcaster Software project.

Nyce is built on modern TypeScript and React Frameworks to allow the most flexibility and development processes.

## Roadmap
Nyce is in it's very early stages and I do not currently plan on supporting it for external developers, but feel free to pull or install and begin working with it to see what you can accomplish.

## Examples
At the time of writing this I am in the process of developing the first set of graphics to use the framework, which will also add as a basis for how Nyce is built and structured, until this time nothing will be set and things are likely to change.
